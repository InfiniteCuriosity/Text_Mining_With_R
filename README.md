# Text_Mining_With_R
Working through the excellent book, Text Mining with R by Julia Silge and David Robinson

The book covers a number of packages and methods to do text analysis using R. This looks very interesting to me, and I can easily see many applications of the methods covered in the book. For example, it will be interesting to me to to apply the methods to news reports, job postings, and twitter feeds.

The fact that the book is based on the tidyverse is excellent, in my view. This gives it a lot of power that is not available in base R or other systems.
